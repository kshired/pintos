/* Child process for syn-rw.
   Reads from a file created by our parent process, which is
   growing it.  We loop until we've read the whole file
   successfully.  Many iterations through the loop will return 0
   bytes, because the file has not grown in the meantime.  That
   is, we are "busy waiting" for the file to grow.
   (This test could be improved by adding a "yield" system call
   and calling yield whenever we receive a 0-byte read.) */
