/* Recursively executes itself until the child fails to execute.
   We expect that at least 30 copies can run.

   We count how many children your kernel was able to execute
   before it fails to start a new process.  We require that,
   if a process doesn't actually get to start, exec() must
   return -1, not a valid PID.

   We repeat this process 10 times, checking that your kernel
   allows for the same level of depth every time.

   In addition, some processes will spawn children that terminate
   abnormally after allocating some resources.
